In 2016 the Masters of Tangible Interaction Design (MTID) program came back to Carnegie Mellon University. With its reintroduction the program needed a image, a platform to speak from. Our goal was to showcase the different types of projects that the MTID students are working on, from installation pieces to virtual reality pieces and many projects in between. We also wanted to create a brand system that could be adapted for all types of media: print (static), web (static or animated), and interactive. We chose to express the diversity of projects through imagery of the work along with several shapes exploring different moods while maintaining the overall brand through the consistent use of the ‘TiD’ logo.
